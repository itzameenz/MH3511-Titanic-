# R code explainers (`rcode_explain/`)

Each **`.md` file** matches one **`.R` script** (same base name). Besides the table below, **open the matching explainer** for a **long written explanation** (what the script does in words, what to copy from the console, how to describe figures, and statistical caveats).

**How each explainer is structured**

| Block | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **Report** | Which part of `REPORT_README.md` this supports |
| **One line** | Plain-language goal |
| **Before you run** | Working directory + files you need |
| **What the script does** | Logic in words |
| **Console** | Copy-paste candidates for the report |
| **Figures** | `output/figures/...` (skipped if **ggplot2** not installed) |
| **Write-up** | Interpretation and caveats |

**Run order:** run **`data_cleaning/clean_and_save_titanic.R`** once, then any `R/sec*.R`, or use **`source("R/run_all_analysis.R")`** from the project root.

**Shared setup:** every `R/sec*.R` sources **`R/bootstrap_paths.R`** and calls **`load_titanic_clean()`** (reads `data/titanic_cleaned.csv`).
